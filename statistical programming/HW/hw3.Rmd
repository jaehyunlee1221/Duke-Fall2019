# Introduction

>America does a poor job tracking and accounting for its unsolved homicides. 
Every year, at least 5,000 killers get away with murder. The rate at which 
police clear homicides through arrest has declined over the years until, today, 
about a third go unsolved.
<br/><br/>
The Murder Accountability Project is a nonprofit group organized in 2015 and 
dedicated to educate Americans on the importance of accurately accounting for 
unsolved homicides within the United States.

### Tasks 1 {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

#### Question 1 { - .tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

How many distinct counties in North Carolina had a recorded homicide in 2017?

```{r Q1:distinct counties}
#NA check according to columns
colSums(is.na(murder))

Q1 <- murder %>% 
  filter(year == 2017 & state == "North Carolina") %>%
  select(cntyfips) %>%
  n_distinct()
Q1
```
***There are 73 distinct counties in North Carolina had a recorded homicide in 2017.***

#### Question 2 { - .tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

Which year and month combinations had the three most homicides in North Carolina from 2013 to 2017?

```{r Q2:three most homicides}
Q2 <- murder %>%
  select(year, month, state, homicide) %>%
  filter(year >= 2013 & year <= 2017) %>%
  filter(state == "North Carolina") %>%
  group_by(year,month) %>%
  summarise(
    count = n()
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(count)) %>%
  head(3)
Q2
```
***August 2017, March 2016 and April 2017 had the three most homicides in North Carolina from 2013 to 2017.***

#### Question 3 { - .tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

What were the top three states that had the most homicides by "Murder and non-negligent manslaughter" that were solved and crossed racial lines, i.e., where the offender and victim were of different race? Include the counts in your answer.

```{r Q3:top three states}
Q3 <- murder %>%
  filter(homicide == "Murder and non-negligent manslaughter") %>%
  filter(solved == "Yes") %>%
  filter(vicrace != "Unknown", offrace != "Unknown") %>%
  filter(vicrace != offrace) %>%
  select(vicrace, offrace, state, homicide) %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarise(
    count = n()
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(count)) %>%
  slice(1:3)
Q3
```
***The top three states that had the most homicides by "Murder and non-negligent manslaughter" that were solved and crossed racial lines are California, Texas and New York with total number of homicides of 10767, 6766 and 5518 respectively.***

#### Question 4 { - .tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

For the state of California, what is the relative frequency of unsolved homicides for each year in the data set?

```{r Q4:relative frequency}
Q4_1 <- murder %>%
  filter(state == "California") %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  select(year, solved) %>%
  summarise(
    count = n()
  )
Q4_2 <- murder %>%
  filter(state == "California") %>%
  filter(solved == "No") %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  select(year, solved) %>%
  summarise(
    count = n()
  )
Q4 <- data.frame(year = Q4_1$year, ratio = Q4_2$count/Q4_1$count) 
Q4
```
***In the above table, variable ratio represents the relative frequency of unsolved homicides for each year in California.***

#### Question 5 { - .tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

Define a variable age_gap as the offender's age minus the victim's age. For each offender sex level (not Unknowns), what is the median age gap, 10th percentile age gap, and 90th percentile age gap? Your output should be in a single data frame.

```{r Q5:age gap}
Q5_1 <- murder %>% 
  filter(offage != 999, vicage != 999) %>%
  filter(offsex != "Unknown") %>%
  mutate(age_gap = offage - vicage)

Q5 <- Q5_1 %>%
  filter(offsex != "Unknown") %>% 
  filter(offage != 999, vicage != 999) %>%
  group_by(offsex) %>%
  summarise(
    med_age_gap = median(age_gap),
    lower_age_gap = quantile(age_gap, 0.1),
    upper_age_gap = quantile(age_gap, 0.9)
  )
Q5
```
***For Female, median, l0th percentile, 90th percentile for age_gap is -1, -22, 23. For Male, median, 10th percentile, 90th percentile for age_gap is 0, -24, 17***


#### Question 6 { - .tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

Which five states had the largest change in the number of homicides by "Murder and non-negligent manslaughter" in the 10 years before and after the 1994 crime bill? Consider 1985 - 1994 and 1995 - 2004.

```{r Q6:top five states largest change}
Q6 <- murder %>%
  filter(homicide == "Murder and non-negligent manslaughter") %>%
  filter(year >= 1985 & year <= 2004) %>%
  mutate(b1994 = ifelse(year <= 1994, 'B', 'A')) %>%
  group_by(state, b1994) %>%
  summarise(
    count = n()
  ) %>%
  mutate(change = abs(count - lag(count)))
Q6 <- Q6 %>%
  select(state, change) %>%
  na.omit %>%
  arrange(desc(change)) %>%
  head(5)
Q6
```
***New York, California, Texas, Michigan and Florida had the largest change in the number of homicides by "Murder and non-negligent manslaughter" between year 1985-1994 and year 1995-2004.***


### Task 2 {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

#### Question 1 { - .tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

Based on your initial (further) analysis, form a narrative of what can be conveyed to a reader using the data and possibly supplementary data.
	
__As stated above, the Murder Accountability Project is a nonprofit group organized in 2015 and 
dedicated to educate Americans on the importance of accurately accounting for 
unsolved homicides within the United States. There are a myriad of factors necessary to effectively solve homicides. Thus, detailed analysis of homicide occurrences across the United States is paramount to the mitigation of unsolved homicides.
The overall objective of this analysis is to determine the prevalence of firearm use in unsolved homicides within states maintaining high frequencies of unsolved homicides. Gun control is currently a prominent issue across the United States, with an extensive and turbulent political, legal, and social history. Given that the issue is exceedingly current, it is important to generate and monitor statistics pertaining to the impact of firearm violence. This directly pertains to the Murder Accountability Project, as determination of the prevalence of firearm use in unsolved homicides can provide insight into important factors pertaining to unsolved homicides. The results of our study indicates that firearm use is prevalent in unsolved homicides for the states of California, New York, and Texas from 1976 to 2017, potentially highlighting an important trend pertaining to weapon use in unsolved homicides throughout the United States.__ 

#### Question 2 { - .tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}
Create a visualization or set of visualizations that depict this narrative. They should tell an interesting story and / or provide insights into the underlying data. There is no single correct answer for these data and your visualization should depend on what your narrative is for the reader. Your visualization(s) should use `ggplot` or one of its extensions and may be supplemented by outside data.

__To begin our analysis, we will determine the three states with the highest number of unsolved homicides from the years 1976 to 2017, and present this information in a map for clear visual interpretation.__

```{r murder-state info dataset}
state <- map_data("state")
state_murder <- murder %>%
  select(id, state, solved, year, homicide) %>%
  filter(solved == "No") %>%
  mutate(lstate = tolower(state)) %>%
  group_by(lstate) %>%
  summarise(
    count = n()
  )
colnames(state)[5] <- "lstate"
state_murder <- inner_join(state_murder,state, by = "lstate")
```

```{r determine-states}
kable(murder %>%
  filter(solved == 'No') %>%
  select(state) %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count)) %>%
  head(3),caption = "3 Most unsolved homicide")
```

__We determine that the states of California, New York, and Texas have the highest number of unsolved homicides from 1976 to 2017, with unsolved homicide counts of 42,337, 26,407, and 17,253, respectively. We can graphically display this via a geographic map of the United States, where a darker red color corresponds with a higher number of unsolved homicide counts.__

##### Plot 1 {-}

```{r US map with count for unsolved homicide, fig.cap = "Number of unsolved homicide by states", eval = FALSE}
state2 <- state %>%
  filter(lstate %in% c("california"))
state3 <- state %>%
  filter(lstate %in% c("new york"))
state4 <- state %>%
  filter(lstate %in% c("texas"))

ggplot(data = state_murder, aes(x = long, y = lat)) + 
  geom_polygon(mapping = aes(fill = count, group = group), color = "black") +
  geom_encircle(aes(x = long, y = lat),data = state2, color = "red", size = 2, expand = 0.03) +
  geom_encircle(aes(x = long, y = lat),data = state3, color = "red", size = 2, expand = 0.03) +
  geom_encircle(aes(x = long, y = lat),data = state4, color = "red", size = 2, expand = 0.03) +
  coord_fixed(1.3) + 
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "#CB454A") +
  theme(
      plot.background = element_blank()
     ,panel.grid.major = element_blank()
     ,panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
    ) +
  labs(title = "Number of Unsolved Homicide across the United States, by State", x = "Longitude", y = "Latitude", fill = "Count") + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

__The map clearly shows that from 1976 to 2017, the three states with the highest number of unsolved homicides are California, New York, and Texas. __

***How do the counts of unsolved homicides differ by year?***

__We now restrict the data to only observations from the three states with the highest number of unsolved homicides from the years 1976 to 2017. While this causes loss of generalizability for homicides occurring across the United States, subsetting the data allows for identification of important state-specific trends where the highest number of unsolved homicides have occurred in recent years. __

##### Plot 2 {-}

```{r unsolved-homicide-count, fig.cap = "Time series trend of unsolved homice in three states", eval = FALSE}
unsolved_homicide_count <-
  murder %>%
  filter(state=='California' | state=='New York' | state=='Texas') %>%
  filter(solved=='No') %>%
  select(year, state) %>%
  group_by(year, state) %>%
  summarize(unsolved_homicide_count=n())
ggplot(data=unsolved_homicide_count, mapping=aes(x=year, y=unsolved_homicide_count, color=state)) + 
  geom_line(show.legend=T) + 
  labs(title = "Number of Unsolved Homicides \n in California, New York, and Texas from 1976 to 2017", x = "Year", y = "Unsolved Homicide Count", fill = "State") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + 
  transition_reveal(year)
```

__From the trend line plot presented above, we observe the trends from 1976 to 2017 of the number of total unsolved homicides in the top three states. We observe that while the counts are different for each respective state, the three count lines exhibit overall similar trends across the years. The maximum of unsolved homicide counts for all three states occur around the year 1993, decrease until 2000, then show a modest increase followed by a general decrease. From 1990 onwards, California clearly maintains the highest number of unsolved homicides by year.__


##### Plot 3 {-}

__Now, we will extend our analysis to determine the proportion of unsolved homicides where a firearm was used as the homicide weapon from 1976 to 2017 across the top three states.__

###### Figure 1 {-}
```{r assign-weapon-variable, eval = FALSE}
unsolved_homicide_count2 <-
  murder %>%
  filter(state=='California' | state=='New York' | state=='Texas') %>%
  filter(solved=='No') %>%
  select(year, state, weapon) %>%
  filter(!is.na(year), !is.na(state), !is.na(weapon))

#unique(unsolved_homicide_count2$weapon)
weapon_gun <- c("Firearm, type not stated", "Rifle", "Shotgun", "Other gun", "Handgun - pistol, revolver, etc")
unsolved_homicide_count2 <- unsolved_homicide_count2 %>%
  mutate(gun = ifelse(weapon %in% weapon_gun, TRUE, FALSE))

ggplot(data=unsolved_homicide_count2, aes(x=year, fill = factor(gun, labels = c("Firearm not used as weapon", "Firearm used as weapon")))) + 
  geom_bar(position = "fill") + 
  labs(title = "Proportion of Unsolved Homicides and Firearm Use \n in California, New York, and Texas from 1976 to 2017", x = "Year", y = "Frequency of Firearm Use, by Proportion", fill = "Weapon") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("lightsteelblue3", "red3")) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, linetype = "dashed") + 
  transition_states(year) + shadow_mark() + enter_grow() 
```

__For all included years, the proportion of unsolved homicides in California, New York, and Texas where a firearm was used as the homicide weapon is above 0.50, as can be verified by the reference line. From 1976 to 2017, the plot indicates an overall increase in the proportion of unsolved homicides where a firearm was used as the homicide weapon. The plot demonstrates that firearms are the involved weapons for the majority of unsolved homicides in California, New York, and Texas from 1976 to 2017, and that this majority increases over the given time range. Overall, the plot provides evidence that firearm use is prevalent in unsolved homicides.__

__We now analyze the proportion of unsolved homicides where a firearm was used as the homicide weapon between the three states.__

```

__California: In 1976, the proportion of unsolved homicides where a firearm was used as the homicide weapon was below 0.50. The proportion then follows an increase, reaching a maximum in 2006. After 2006, the proportion appears to stablize around 0.81, indicating that approximately 81% of unsolved homicides in California occurring from 2007 to 2017 involved the use of a firearm as the homicide weapon.__

__New York: The proportion of unsolved homicides where a firearm was used as the homicide weapon is at or above 0.50 for all years, except 2006. We posit that this discrepancy may be due to the 2006 New York state law enactment that increased the mandatory prison sentence for illegal carry of a loaded weapon from one year to three and a half years (information referenced from "Prison Isn't as Mandatory as State's Gun Laws Say" by Roberts, available at https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/nyregion/prison-not-as-mandatory-as-ny-state-gun-laws-say.html). Certainly, this requires further analysis. Overall, while we note a general increase in the proportion of unsolved homicides where a firearm was used as the homicide weapon over the given time range, the increase does not appear to be as steep nor reach the magnitude of the proportion pertaining to the state of California.__

__Texas: The minimum proportion of unsolved homicides where a firearm was used as the homicide weapon occurred in 1987, and then follows a general increase to stablize around 0.78 for the last three years of the time range: 2015, 2016, and 2017. This indicates that approximately 78% of unsolved homicides in Texas occurring from 2015 to 2017 involved the use of a firearm as the homicide weapon.__

__Overall, the plots provide evidence that firearm use is prevalent in unsolved homicides for each individual state of California, New York, and Texas from 1976 to 2017. We present this conclusion with a second visualization of a parliament plot, which further elucidates our narrative.__

}
```

__In conclusion, our study indicates that firearm use is prevalent in unsolved homicides for the states of California, New York, and Texas from 1976 to 2017, potentially highlighting an important trend pertaining to weapon use in unsolved homicides throughout the United States. Further research is required to better define the potential association between the variables considered in this analysis, as well as to determine the potential presence of omitted variable bias: indeed, the analysis underscores the importance and need for further research pertaining to both firearm violence and unsolved homicides in the United States.__

#### Question 3 { - .tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

3. Provide a write-up describing your design choices for your visualization(s). Explain why your visualization(s) is effective at elucidating your narrative.

__We begin with a geographic map to provide readers with an identifiable and clear frame of reference for the context of our data. The use of color, where a darker red color corresponds with a higher number of unsolved homicide counts, is easy to comprehend and conveys the results of the preceding table in a meaningful way.__

__The animated trend line plot, using ggplot with geom_line(), provides readers with a time-series feeling for the frequency of total unsolved homicides in California, New York, and Texas from 1976 to 2017. The trend lines for the three states, plotted on the same graph, are easy to identify and compare, and the animation actively involves readers in interpreting and understanding the data.__

__We use proportion plots to determine firearm prevalence in unsolved homicides across and between states because proportions standardize the differences among the sample size of groups - here, the differences among the counts of unsolved homicides of states. Additionally, the proportion barplot allows us to add a horizontal reference line at y = 0.5, denoting the 50% majority line for the data. This clarifies the graphical visualization, as readers can easily see when the proportion of unsolved homicides where a firearm was used as the homicide weapon is below or above 0.50, respectively.__

### Task 3 {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}
