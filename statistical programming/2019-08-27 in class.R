#exercise1
#what does each of the following return? run the code to chekc your answer
if (1 == "1") "coercion works" else "no coercion"
ifelse(5>c(1,10,2),"hello","olleh")

#exercise2
#consider two vectors x,y each of length one. Write a set of conditional that satisfy the following
#If x is positive and y is negative or y is positive and x is negative, print "knits".
#If x divided by y is positive, print "stink".
#Stop execution if x or y are zero.

x <- 4

  stop( "x or y are zero")
} else if (x*y<0) {
  print("knit")
} else if (x/y>0) {
  print("stink")
}

#exercise3
#Consider the vector x below.
#x <- c(3, 4, 12, 19, 23, 49, 100, 63, 70)
#Write R code that prints the square numbers in x.

#suggested answer sqrt(i) %% 1 ==0

#exercise4
#Consider z <- c(-1, .5, 0, .5, 1). Write R code that prints the smallest non-negative integer 
#k satisfying the inequality
#|cos(k)âˆ’z|<0.001 for each component of z.
